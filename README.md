### DiscordPanel   
##### The only free open source Discord Bot Panel to manage up to 4 bots.

## What is it?
DiscordPanel is an HTML, PHP, CSS, JS, and more designed discord bot software what works as a panel.
Currently, you can, restart, stop and start a bot from the panel.
You can have an unlimited number of bots added as long as you have the details.
There is a rated development knowledge of 2.4/10 to use this script.
There is a To-Do page where you can add, edit and remove items!
There is a BUG area where you can list any bugs your bot/bots may have. There is also a widget on the home screen
The whole code is open source, what is amazing!

## Why use DiscordPanel? 
We own and run around 14 discord bots what are on hundreds of thousands discord servers, so downtime can impact us a lot. So our lead developer designed a software called DiscordPanel the only free self hosted discord bot control panel. If your bot is on discordbots.org then you can use the status widget on the homescreen, but don't worry as in a future update we will be adding another way to use the status widget.
